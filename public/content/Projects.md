## TravelNook
Developed a centralized platform for hotel bookings and listings by designing the microservices architecture diagram to address scalability challenges and optimize communication patterns through synchronous and asynchronous methods. Engineered a booking management microservice using Flask and a payment service integrated with Stripe, containerizing both with Docker. Created comprehensive component tests and integrated them into the CI/CD pipeline for enhanced reliability, while also implementing Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing checks to strengthen DevSecOps practices. Orchestrated the deployment on Kubernetes, utilizing Grafana and Prometheus for detailed metric visualization, with infrastructure codified using Terraform. Additionally, facilitated seamless integration among diverse microservices and played a key role in both frontend development and the integration of the frontend with the backend.

## Ascenda Admin System
Worked with Ascenda to help build an administrative system that streamlines tasks, customer support, and departmental management, enhancing data visibility and operational efficiency with robust user roles, permissions, and access controls to prevent misuse. Played a key role in designing the deployment architecture, ensuring the selection of appropriate AWS services for the use case. Built admin proxy and points microservices using Flask, focusing on separation of concerns and adherence to SOLID principles. Deployed backend microservices to ECS clusters and databases to RDS, implementing least privilege access through security group configurations and ensuring redundancy with autoscaling in ECS. Facilitated communication between microservices within the same cluster and across availability zones. Developed Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines with GitHub Actions to automate deployments upon merging of pull requests.

## The Green Investor
The Green Investor is a turn-based business simulation trivia game that will require you to balance your company's profitability and sustainability. As part of the project theme, 'Climate Change', The Green Investor aims to educate potential retail investors about the opportunities and challenges of sustainable investing. To prevent further irreversible impacts on the planet, businesses must take more initiative in preventing climate change. Hence, it is crucial that companies adapt and evolve their business into a sustainable model.They will be tasked to make decisions which will affect their in game statistics which includes money, sustainability and morale. The backend of this application was built on spring boot and the frontend was built on React. Various microservices such as weekly email notifications, translation and search engine optimization was implemented. Various security implementations such as JWT token was also implemented within this application. I was heavily involved in the frontend development, integration with the backend as well as certain APIs such as email notifications on the backend.

## AI Project
During my enrollment in the "Intro to AI" module, I engaged in several assignments that provided me with hands-on experience on diverse platforms, including TensorFlow. One notable task involved training an artificial neural network (ANN) classifier to accurately identify handwritten digits sourced from the MNIST dataset. To challenge the model's robustness, I intentionally introduced noise to the images, requiring me to fine-tune various parameters until achieving a commendable 95% accuracy rate when evaluating the test dataset. Furthermore, I delved into the realm of convolutional neural networks (CNN) by implementing a model specifically designed for a binary alpha digit dataset. Leveraging the powerful technique of transfer learning, I capitalized on pre-existing knowledge to enhance the CNN's performance on this unique dataset. In another assignment, I explored the concept of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) by employing cooccurrence matrices to derive word embeddings. This involved implementing the SVD algorithm to capture meaningful representations of words within a given context. Additionally, I eagerly ventured into the realm of reinforcement learning by implementing a Q-learning model using the OpenAI Gym framework. This endeavor offered me valuable insights into the fundamental principles and techniques employed in reinforcement learning.

## Multilingual Medical Diagnosis
Researched and optimized transformer and smaller models for conversational medical question answering, focusing on the Chinese Medical Dialogue dataset to enhance cross-linguistic diagnostic capabilities. Experimented with T5 and Flan-T5 base models, fine-tuning them with various datasets, including Chinese datasets, to improve the accuracy of responses. Collaborated with team members to evaluate different models and methodologies, achieving qualitative results on unseen data to assess overall model performance.
