## OfficeProductivity
OfficeProductivity was a personal project and is a one-stop communication and task-allocation platform for office workers. I built the user interface using React stateful components to allow users to effortlessly communicate with their fellow colleagues as well as to update them about their life stories. The Backend was set up in MongoDB atlas using mongoose schema. I connected the front-end application to the back-end using Axios and Express.js Additionally, I implemented real-time messaging using SocketIO.

## The Green Investor
The Green Investor is a turn-based business simulation trivia game that will require you to balance your company's profitability and sustainability. As part of the project theme, 'Climate Change', The Green Investor aims to educate potential retail investors about the opportunities and challenges of sustainable investing. To prevent further irreversible impacts on the planet, businesses must take more initiative in preventing climate change. Hence, it is crucial that companies adapt and evolve their business into a sustainable model.They will be tasked to make decisions which will affect their in game statistics which includes money, sustainability and morale. The backend of this application was built on spring boot and the frontend was built on React. Various microservices such as weekly email notifications, translation and search engine optimization was implemented. Various security implementations such as JWT token was also implemented within this application. I was heavily involved in the frontend development, integration with the backend as well as certain APIs such as email notifications on the backend.

## AI Project
During my enrollment in the "Intro to AI" module, I engaged in several assignments that provided me with hands-on experience on diverse platforms, including TensorFlow. One notable task involved training an artificial neural network (ANN) classifier to accurately identify handwritten digits sourced from the MNIST dataset. To challenge the model's robustness, I intentionally introduced noise to the images, requiring me to fine-tune various parameters until achieving a commendable 95% accuracy rate when evaluating the test dataset. Furthermore, I delved into the realm of convolutional neural networks (CNN) by implementing a model specifically designed for a binary alpha digit dataset. Leveraging the powerful technique of transfer learning, I capitalized on pre-existing knowledge to enhance the CNN's performance on this unique dataset. In another assignment, I explored the concept of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) by employing cooccurrence matrices to derive word embeddings. This involved implementing the SVD algorithm to capture meaningful representations of words within a given context. Additionally, I eagerly ventured into the realm of reinforcement learning by implementing a Q-learning model using the OpenAI Gym framework. This endeavor offered me valuable insights into the fundamental principles and techniques employed in reinforcement learning.
