TravelLocal is a project built during Lifehack 2023 and it was chosen as one of the top 15 projects of the hackathon. TravelLocal aims to connect tourists with locals to allow them to gain an authentic experience. We created the application using React for the frontend and Flask for the backend. It serves as a platform where locals can upload short videos to promote their tour packages to the tourists. Tourists are then given the freedom to pick their tour guide as well as their package based on the reviews and the videos. For secure authentication, we utilised SGID to allow Singaporeans to login using their Singpass.

## ServiceFinder
ServiceFinder was developed during a hackathon held by Goldman Sachs. We implemented a platform that helps new companies that are planning to enter the banking industry find services provided by Goldman Sachs easily. We designed an interactive frontend design using React.js and the backend was set up using Spring Boot. The database that we decided to use was SQL. I was involved in the development of the frontend, integration of the frontend with the backend as well as the development of API involving relational schemas in the backend to post data inputed by the users into our SQL database.

## FoodHeroes
FoodHeroes was built during NUS Lifehack hackathon and it serves as a platform that connects restaurants with volunteers who then help to transport excess food at the end of the day. Food wastage is currently a big issue where restaurants and F&B outlets tend to make excess so we were inspired to tackle this problem. Therefore, we implemented a platform where restaurants can list their excess food items and users are able to scan through and pick the items that they would like to deliver. The front-end UI was built using React.js and the data received by users was stored in a Firebase storage which was constantly refreshed and displayed on the front-end.

## FlappyBird
As part of the "Operation Systems with Android" module, I was involved in the development of a Flappy Bird clone using the platform of Android Studio. Within this project, I took on the responsibility of constructing the fundamental infrastructure of the application, while also integrating various interactive elements such as game physics, sound effects, vibration feedback, and collision detection. To enhance performance and ensure a seamless user experience, I adeptly employed the concept of multithreading to execute different processes concurrently. This approach allowed for efficient score tracking and gameplay mechanics, minimizing latency and optimizing overall responsiveness.

## OfficeProductivity
OfficeProductivity was a personal project and is a one-stop communication and task-allocation platform for office workers. I built the user interface using React stateful components to allow users to effortlessly communicate with their fellow colleagues as well as to update them about their life stories. The Backend was set up in MongoDB atlas using mongoose schema. I connected the front-end application to the back-end using Axios and Express.js Additionally, I implemented real-time messaging using SocketIO.

## MOVIE API
I undertook a project with the aim of acquiring proficiency in the C# language and the .NET framework. I developed an API that encompassed movie and actor entities interconnected through a one-to-many relationship. To facilitate seamless data management, I implemented the CRUD operations. Furthermore, I incorporated role-based authorization and authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to the API. For database management, I leveraged mongoDB and configured it to run locally within a Docker image. To monitor the health and availability of the API, I included health checks that continuously assessed its functionality and provided alerts if any issues arose. In order to guarantee the correct behavior of the API, I conducted unit tests utilizing the .NET libraries. These tests were designed to validate the accuracy of the controller's actions.

## Tensorflow
I embarked on a project to learn Tensorflow as I have an avid interest in Artifical Intelligence and Tensorflow is one of the most popular frameworks used in today's industry. This is a simple sentiment analysis project where it checks if a review is a positive or a negative review. Data for movie reviews was retrieved from an online source and was used to train and test the data. Pandas and Numpy Libraries were used to study the data as well. Preprocessing by cleaning the data and removing unnecessary componenents within the reviews were done to increase the accuracy of the ML model. The algorithm that I decided to use to train the model was the LinearSVC algorithm.

## Data Science Assignment
As part of a school project, my group tasked to analyze an American housing database containing 1000 data points by plotting graphs using various libraries within python such as Pandas and Numpy to find variables that have a correlation. We also conducted problem formulation, dataset exploration, data pre-processing, feature selection, model building and model evaluation for both categorical and numerical variables.
